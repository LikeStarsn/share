## React fiber
react-fiber is my self-study project help me understand how react work. In fact, all codebase re-implement each step , so it looks similar to the source code of react. Though, I think it's still smaller and easier to understand than when you actually read the react source code. I hope it helpful for people who want to start learn how react fiber work.

## Something you should read and learn before start read source code

### Keyword
  ```
  work (unitOfWork): A component, node element => fiber

  current: Current fiber what is displayed on browser

  WIP (workInProgress): New fiber tree we will build

  fiber: {
    type: string | Function ('div', 'span', function Button)
    instanceNode: HTMLElement (div, span)
    return: fiber (parent of fiber)
    child: fiber (child of fiber)
    sibling: fiber (sibling of fiber)

    alternate: link current - WIP and WIP - current
    effectTag: number (give we know what will happen this fiber)

  }

  requestIdleCallback

  main function:
    createWorkInProgress()
    beginWork()
    reconcileChildren()
    completeWork()
    commitWork()
  ```

### Process of first render
  ```
  Render -> Reconciler -> Scheduler ->
  Begin Work (build fiber tree) -> ChildReconciler(create child and effectTag) -> if work has child we will continue to run beginWork -> no child ->              
  Complete Work (build list effect, mark tag and create instanceNode) -> sibling has child -> turn back Begin Work -> no child -> Complete Work -> no sibling -> has a new tree with effect tag ->
  Commit Work : It will base on list effect tag to commit each fiber (Placement, Update, Delete, Lifecycle)

  // In first render current fiber is null.
  // current is workInProgress when commit
  ```
### Process when update
  ```
  Do something ->
  Get current Fiber what corresponding to the component ->
  Recursive to find Root ->
  Clone fiber from root to component has update ->
  Begin Work from this fiber (it's maybe clone fiber when children of component use memo, pure component or use shouldComponentUpdate) ->
  Complete Work ->
  Commit Work
  ```

### About With(Hook v16.7)
  ```
  Hooks are stored as a linked list on the fiber's prevState field of fiber.
  current tree - current hook <=> WIP - WIP hook

  ```
